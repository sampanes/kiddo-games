# kiddo-games
Literally just kiddo games, designed by kids so don't expect too much.

## Overview
This repository is a collection of fun, simple games designed with (and often by) kids. 
Expect creative ideas, quirky mechanics, and plenty of imagination. These games are intended 
to be lightweight, easy to run in a browser, and completely free to play.

## Games
Currently included:
- **Unicorn's Adventure Around the World (UAAW)** — Play as a unicorn monster truck, climb hills, 
  explore houses, and party at the end of the track. Beware the many-legged, three-eyed cat-eared monster under the hill!

Planned future additions:
- More mini-games based on kiddo ideas.
